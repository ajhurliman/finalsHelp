{"default": "This message is provided as a courtesy to all guests regarding potential visa requirements.  Some countries require you to obtain and carry with you official documentation, called a visa, before entering that country.   It is your sole responsibility to obtain and have available the proper travel documents necessary for your travel, including all associated costs related to obtaining your travel documents. Boarding may be denied if you arrive at the pier without the proper travel documentation, and in that case you are not eligible for a refund.  <br/><br/>Visa and documentation requirements vary by nationality and destination. Please review your itinerary and verify your specific travel requirements.  Guests should check with a visa service or the consulate of each country they will visit to verify travel documentation, and should reconfirm those requirements with the appropriate consulate(s) 14-30 days prior to the cruise. <br/><br/>Please visit the <a style=\"color:red;\" href=\"http://www.hollandamerica.com/cruise-vacation-planning/PlanningAndAdvice.action?tabName=Cruise+Preparation&contentMenu=Essential+Documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Personal Travel Identification Requirements</a> page for more information."}
